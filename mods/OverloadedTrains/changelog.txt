0.17.4 / 0.18.4
- Trains in automatic mode have no weight modifier when braking to prevent abrupt stops.

0.17.3 / 0.18.3
- Should be more stable now...

0.16.6	(2018-11-02)
- Reduced the base speed multiplier to 1.0 (from 1.3)
I felt like the acceleration when empty was a bit fast when the train was empty and had nuclear fuel (and really extreme when you had exoskeletons in the train equipment)

0.16.5	(2018-11-02)
- Fixed an error when a train was abruptly changing the direction

0.16.3	(2018-10-01)
- Forgot to remove the debug message when crafting...^^

0.16.2	(2018-10-01)
- No idea how that comma sneaked in there, now it should load^^
