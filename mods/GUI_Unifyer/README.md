# GUI Unifyer
Factorio Mod forcing mod buttons to look uniform and aligned, harmonizes most icons.
(Continuation of Better_Modbuttons by Dr_Pepper)

⚠️ Currently, there's no way to cleanly uninstall the mod from a save (will leave empty icons)
Consult with your doctor to see if GUI Unifyer is right for you
