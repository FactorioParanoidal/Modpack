Version: 0.16.2
Date: 2019-08-20

  Major Features:
    - Changed Ratio of smelting from 4/3 (1.33) to 5/4 (1.25)
    - So that with productivity (1.5) ratio of iron to steel is 2 to 3.

Version: 0.16.3
Date: 2019-08-20

  Major Features:
    - Made high temperature oil disabled by default (even though the recipe couldn't be used)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.16.4
Date: 2019-08-20

  Major Features:
    - Added productivity to Oil
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.16.5
Date: 2019-08-20

  Major Features:
    - Now should work with all mods ^-^
    - Nuclear fuel
    - 1 u235 = 1.21gj
    - Uranium fuel cell
    - 1 u235 = 10 cells or 14 with prod
    - 1 cell = 8gj
    - 1 cycle with +300% neighbor bonus = 4x
    - 1 u235 = 14 * 8 * 4 = 448gj
    - 370x more power per u235 than nuclear fuel.
    - Reduced uranium fuel output from 10 to 1
    - therefore this means its 37x more energy.
    - It also means that instead of 1 fuel cell crafter producing enough for 140 reactors.
    - It produces enough for 14 reactors... (with prod)

Version: 0.16.6
Date: 2019-08-20

  Major Features:
    - Fixed issue with recipes that have expensive and normal prototypes. Steel now has 1.2 productivity in both normal and marathon mode.
    - Boosted nuclear fuel production back up to 5 compared to 10 considering requirements for large bases.

Version: 0.16.7
Date: 2019-08-20

  Major Features:
    - Changed refining ratios with help from Lordktor since most products that are required is petrol and then light oil. 
    - Decreased light oil from 50 -> 40 increased petrol from 65 -> 70
