This is a factorio mod called "Miles' BobsMods Expansion", currently build against factorio 0.17.59 and bobsmods (Whatever Version is newest and present during the 1st September 2019) The mod expands on a few machines such as assemblers and electronic assemblers but also adds a furnace tier between steel and electric: The early electric furnace. Other features are still planned and any ideas can be submitted on github or the Modpage.

This is meant to be used with Bob's Mods and will work with as little as "Bob's Functions Library" (boblibrary), "Bob's Assembling machines" (bobassembly) and "Bob's Modules" (bobmodules).
