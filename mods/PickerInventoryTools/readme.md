# Picker Inventory Tools

Makes managing inventories a lot easier!

Quickly and easily set filters and adjust requests using the handy dandy filter fill toolbar, Automatically shows up whenever you open a requester chest or filterable inventory. Requester chests can be made to quickly request all items in a blueprint by putting it in the first chest slot and clicking the button, or clicking the button with a blueprint in your hand. Copying from an assembler to a requester chest will add the new requests to the old ones instead of clearing them. Usefull for using one requester for multiple machines.
Automatically sort container inventories when opened. Can be toggled off and only sorted when keybind is used.

## Picker Chest Contents Mover

Quickly Move the contents of once chest to another. This is a quick and dirty move. CONTROL+V on the source chest and CONTROL+V on the destination chest. Supports transfering to chests of different sizes that may already have items in them. If not all items will fit into the chest you can paste the remaining items into a different chest. Items with grids or inventories will lose their grids or inventories when transferred. Use this for bulk material only.
